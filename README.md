# Harnessing-deep-learning-techniques-for-early-prognosis-of-oral-cancer-detection
This study proposes an ensemble model combining EfficientNetB3 and ResNet50 for early detection of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). Utilizing transfer learning, selective layer freezing, and dropout techniques, the model achieves high accuracy and generalization, outperforming individual models.
